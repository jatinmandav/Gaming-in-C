Welcome To The Epic Game Of Chess!



This is a Two Player Game, Where the two players are both users!



How To Play : 

Player whose turn comes, need to give the index(or coordinates) of the piece which he wishes to move.

Then on hitting 'ENTER', next promt comes in which the player needs to enter the coordintes of the position he wishes 
to move it.

Ex : If Player1 wants to move pawn one step ahead

Input1 : B2

Input2 : C2



This will move the pawn from 'B2' to 'C2'!


The same goes with all other pieces.


If the coordinate matches with the rules of chess, the piece will move or else it will not.

If you wish to perform castling, give "CASTLING" as input and then the position of the rook!
